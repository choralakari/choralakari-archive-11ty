A collection of synthesized choral arrangements made with Synthesizer V Studio I and RVC.

All of my choral arrangements and other resources are available [here on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nESecS1zvlXZ4XFU2lk9q0EWXgwYFf1v), though old choral arrangements exist, with different voice setups, [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p9GinOItZsilPs28ded7VRMp_iCXhU7c), archived on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/synthesized-choral-arrangements-20250210-t-010813).  
The Akari Kizuna voice model used for the melody/lead of every choral arrangements is available [here on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/1358Adrian/rvc_temp_zipped/resolve/main/akari_kizuna_vocaloid_v4_raw_test_3_e256_s2304.zip?download=true).

### About Eterna Archive

When a piece of music is too intricate to adapt for a custom four-part choir, its arrangement will be in a format for solo voice and chamber pipe organ using Synthesizer V Studio I and [Organteq 2 Trial](https://www.modartt.com/organteq_overview).  
Eterna Archive is a sub-project of Choral Akari Archive that gathers my voice and organ renditions, and it also mainly features Christian music.  
The voice library for the solo voice uses [Yǒngyè Minus AI](https://synthv.me/Singing%20Voice%20Databases/MINUS/). Organ stops used are the following: Flöte 8’ + 4’ for single manual, and Gross Untersatz 32’ + 16’ and Flöte 8’ for pedalboard.

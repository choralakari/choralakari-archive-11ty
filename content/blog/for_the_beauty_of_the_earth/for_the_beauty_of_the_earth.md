### Representative Text

*1*  
For the beauty of the earth,  
for the glory of the skies,  
for the love which from our birth  
over and around us lies,  
  
*Refrain:*  
Christ, our Lord, to you we raise  
this, our hymn of grateful praise.  
  
*2*  
For the wonder of each hour  
of the day and of the night,  
hill and vale and tree and flower,  
sun and moon and stars of light, *[Refrain]*  
  
*3*  
For the joy of ear and eye,  
for the heart and mind’s delight,  
for the mystic harmony  
linking sense to sound and sight: *[Refrain]*  
  
*4*  
For the joy of human love,  
brother, sister, parent, child,  
friends on earth, and friends above,  
for all gentle thoughts and mild, *[Refrain]*  
  
*5*  
For yourself, best gift divine,  
to the world so freely given,  
agent of God’s grand design:  
peace on earth and joy in heaven. *[Refrain]*

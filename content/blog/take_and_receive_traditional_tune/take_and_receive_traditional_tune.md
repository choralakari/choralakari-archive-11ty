### Representative Text

Take and receive, O Lord, my liberty;  
Take all my will, my mind, my memory;  
All things I hold and all I own are Thine;  
Thine was the gift, to Thee I all resign.  
Do Thou direct and govern all and sway;  
Do what Thou wilt, command, and I obey;  
Only Thy grace, Thy love on me bestow;  
These make me rich, all else will I forego.

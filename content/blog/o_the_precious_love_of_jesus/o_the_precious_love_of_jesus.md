### Representative Text

*1*  
O the precious love of Jesus,  
Growing sweeter day by day,  
Tuning all my heart, so joyous,  
To a heav'nly melody.  
  
*Refrain:*  
Christ is precious,  
Christ is precious;  
In life's journey He will lead thee;  
Christ is precious,  
Christ is precious;  
He will lead thee all the way.  
  
*2*  
But we cannot know the fullness  
Of the Savior's wondrous love,  
Till we see and know His glory,  
In the heav'nly home above. *[Refrain]*  
  
*3*  
Come and taste the love of Jesus,  
At His feet thy burdens lay;  
Trust Him with thy grief and sorrow,  
Bear this joyful song away. *[Refrain]*

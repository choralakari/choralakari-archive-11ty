### Representative Text

*1*  
Come, Thou Almighty King,  
help us Thy name to sing;  
help us to praise:  
Father, all glorious,  
o'er all victorious,  
come, and reign over us,  
Ancient of Days.  
  
*2*  
Come, Thou Incarnate Word,  
gird on Thy mighty sword,  
our pray'r attend:  
come, and Thy people bless,  
and give Thy Word success:  
Spirit of holiness,  
on us descend.  
  
*3*  
Come, Holy Comforter,  
Thy sacred witness bear  
in this glad hour:  
Thou who almighty art,  
now rule in every heart,  
and ne'er from us depart,  
Spirit of pow'r.  
  
*4*  
To the great One-in-Three,  
eternal praises be  
hence, evermore.  
His sov'reign majesty  
may we in glory see,  
and to eternity  
love and adore!

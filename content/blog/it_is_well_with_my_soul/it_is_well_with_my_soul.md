### Representative Text

*1*  
When peace like a river attendeth my way,  
when sorrows like sea billows roll;  
whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,  
"It is well, it is well with my soul."  
  
*Refrain (may be sung after final stanza only):*  
It is well with my soul;  
it is well, it is well with my soul.  
  
*2*  
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,  
let this blest assurance control:  
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,  
and has shed his own blood for my soul. *[Refrain]*  
  
*3*  
My sin– oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!  
my sin, not in part, but the whole,  
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;  
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! *[Refrain]*  
  
*4*  
O Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,  
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;  
the trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;  
even so, it is well with my soul. *[Refrain]*

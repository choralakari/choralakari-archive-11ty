*1*  
All lands, to God in joyful sounds  
aloft your voices raise;  
sing forth the honor of his name,  
and glorious make his praise,  
and glorious make his praise.  
  
*2*  
Say ye to God, "How terrible  
in all thy works art thou!  
To thee thy foes by thy great pow'r  
shall be constrained to bow,  
shall be constrained to bow.  
  
*3*  
"Yea, all the earth shall worship thee,  
and unto thee shall sing;  
to thy great Name shall songs of joy  
with loud hosannas ring,  
with loud hosannas ring."  
  
*4*  
O come, behold the works of God,  
his mighty doings see;  
in dealing with the sons of men  
most wonderful is he,  
most wonderful is he.  
  
*5*  
He led in safety through the flood  
the people of his choice,  
he turned the sea to solid ground;  
in him let us rejoice,  
in him let us rejoice.  
  
*6*  
He rules forever by his might,  
his eyes the nations try;  
let not the proud, rebellious ones  
exalt themselves on high,  
exalt themselves on high.

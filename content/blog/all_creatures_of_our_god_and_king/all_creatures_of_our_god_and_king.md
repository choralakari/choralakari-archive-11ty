### Representative Text

*1*  
All creatures of our God and King,  
Lift up your voice and with us sing  
Alleluia, alleluia!  
Thou burning sun with golden beam,  
Thou silver moon with softer gleam,  
O praise him, O praise him,  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.  
  
*2*  
Thou rushing winds that art so strong,  
Ye clouds that sail in Heav'n along,  
O praise him, alleluia!  
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,  
Ye lights of evening, find a voice.  
O praise him, O praise him,  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.  
  
*3*  
And all ye saints of tender heart,  
Forgiving others, take your part,  
O sing ye, alleluia!  
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,  
Praise God and on him cast your care:  
O praise him, O praise him,  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.  
  
*4*  
Let all things their creator bless,  
And worship him in humbleness,  
O praise him, alleluia!  
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,  
And praise the Spirit, Three in One:  
O praise him, O praise him,  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

### Representative Text

*1*  
Rejoice, O pure in heart,  
rejoice, give thanks, and sing;  
your festal banner wave on high,  
the cross of Christ your King.  
  
*Refrain:*  
Rejoice,  
rejoice,  
rejoice, give thanks, and sing!  
  
*2*  
Bright youth and snow-crowned age,  
both men and women, raise  
on high your free, exulting song,  
declare God's wondrous praise. *[Refrain]*  
  
*3*  
Still lift your standard high,  
still chanting as you go,  
from youth to age, by night and day,  
in gladness and in woe. *[Refrain]*  
  
*4 (not sung here)*  
At last the march shall end;  
the wearied ones shall rest,  
the pilgrims reach their home at last,  
Jerusalem the blest. *[Refrain]*  
  
*5*  
Praise God, who reigns on high,  
the Lord whom we adore:  
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,  
one God forevermore. *[Refrain]*

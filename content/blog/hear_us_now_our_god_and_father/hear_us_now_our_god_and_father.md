### Representative Text

*1*  
Hear us now, our God and Father;  
Send your Spirit from above  
On this Christian man and woman  
Who here make their vows of love.  
Bind their hearts in true devotion  
Endless as the seashore's sands,  
Boundless as the deepest ocean,  
Blest and sealed by your own hands.  
  
*2*  
Give them joy to lighten sorrow;  
Give them hope to brighten life.  
Go with them to face the morrow;  
Stay with them in every strife.  
As your Word has promised, ever  
Fill them with your strength and grace  
So that each may serve the other  
Till they see you face to face.  
  
*3*  
May the grace of Christ, our Savior,  
And the Father’s boundless love,  
With the Holy Spirit’s favor  
Rest upon them from above.  
Thus may they abide in union  
With each other and the Lord,  
And possess in sweet communion  
Joys which earth cannot afford.

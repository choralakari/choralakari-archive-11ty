### Representative Text

1  
Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature,  
O thou of God and man the Son,  
Thee will I cherish,  
Thee will I honor,  
thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown.  
  
2  
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,  
robed in the blooming garb of spring:  
Jesus is fairer,  
Jesus is purer  
who makes the woeful heart to sing.  
  
3  
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,  
and all the twinkling starry host:  
Jesus shines brighter,  
Jesus shines purer  
than all the angels heaven can boast.  
  
4  
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!  
Son of God and Son of Man!  
Glory and honor,  
praise, adoration,  
now and forevermore be thine.

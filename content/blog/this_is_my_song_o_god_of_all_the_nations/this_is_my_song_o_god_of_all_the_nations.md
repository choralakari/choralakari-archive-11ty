### Representative Text

*1*  
This is my song, O God of all the nations,  
a song of peace for lands afar and mine;  
this is my home, the country where my heart is;  
here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine:  
but other hearts in other lands are beating  
with hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.  
  
*2*  
My country’s skies are bluer than the ocean,  
and sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine;  
but other lands have sunlight too, and clover,  
and skies are everywhere as blue as mine:  
O hear my song, thou God of all the nations,  
a song of peace for their land and for mine.  
  
*3*  
May truth and freedom come to every nation;  
may peace abound where strife has raged so long;  
that each may seek to love and build together,  
a world united, righting every wrong;  
a world united in its love for freedom,  
proclaiming peace together in one song.

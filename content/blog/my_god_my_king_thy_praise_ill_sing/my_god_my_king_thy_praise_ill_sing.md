### Representative Text

*1*  
My God, my King,  
Thy praise I sing,  
My heart is all Thine own;  
My highest powers,  
My choicest hours,  
I yield to Thee alone.  
  
*2*  
My voice awake,  
Thy part to take;  
My soul, the concert join;  
Till all around  
Shall catch the sound,  
And mix their hymns with mine.  
  
*3*  
But man is weak  
Thy praise to speak;  
Your God, ye angels, sing;  
’Tis yours to see,  
More near than we,  
The glories of our King.  
  
*4*  
His truth and grace  
Fill time and space;  
As large His honors be  
Till all that live  
Their homage give  
And praise my God with me.

### Representative Text

*1*  
There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,  
like the wideness of the sea.  
There’s a kindness in God’s justice,  
which is more than liberty.  
  
*2*  
There is welcome for the sinner,  
and more graces for the good.  
There is mercy with the Savior,  
there is healing in his blood.  
  
*3*  
But we make God’s love too narrow  
by false limits of our own,  
and we magnify its strictness  
with a zeal God will not own.  
  
*4*  
For the love of God is broader  
than the measures of the mind,  
and the heart of the Eternal  
is most wonderfully kind.  
  
*5*  
If our love were but more simple,  
we should rest upon God’s word,  
and our lives would be illumined  
by the presence of our Lord.

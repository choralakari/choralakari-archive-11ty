### Representative Text

*1*  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Thou art the potter,  
I am the clay.  
Mold me and make me  
after Thy will,  
While I am waiting,  
yielded and still.  
  
*2*  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Search me and try me,  
Master, today!  
Brighter than snow, Lord,  
wash me just now,  
As in Thy presence  
humbly I bow.  
  
*3*  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Wounded and weary,  
help me, I pray!  
Power, all power,  
surely is Thine!  
Touch me and heal me,  
Savior divine.  
  
*4*  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Hold o’er my being  
absolute sway!  
Fill with Thy Spirit  
’till all shall see  
Christ only, always,  
living in me.

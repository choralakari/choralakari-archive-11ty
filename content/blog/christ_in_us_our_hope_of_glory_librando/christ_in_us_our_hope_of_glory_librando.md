### Representative Text

*1*  
We felt your word burning within us;  
Your word unlocked the hardness of our hearts  
and opened our eyes, that we may see you  
hidden in the broken bread.  
  
*Chorus:*  
Lord, You laid down your life, as bread and wine we see,  
gave strength to our hearts, and made us shine with glee.  
When we eat the bread and drink the cup of wine,  
we believe that Christ in us, is our hope of glory.  
  
*2*  
You brought a ray of light,  
and You rekindled our hope,  
and led our hearts to yearn for Your love,  
for in You is our hope of glory. *[Chorus]*  
  
*Bridge:*  
Through your own flesh, now made living,  
and by the Spirit made life-giving,  
You offer life to us.  
and as you sweat became like drops of blood  
falling down upon the ground,  
You shed Your blood for us. Amen. *[Chorus, then repeat last line]*

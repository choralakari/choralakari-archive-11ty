### Representative Text

*1*  
Father in heaven, Your name we confess,  
High and exalted in bright holiness;  
O may Your kingdom come, Your will be done,  
And may the earth and heav'n be joined as one.  
  
*2*  
O Father, now our daily bread supply,  
And grant forgiveness for iniquity;  
May we forgive as we have been forgiv'n,  
Our hearts with mercy filled, as Yours in heav'n.  
  
*3*  
O Father, lead us from temptation's pow'r;  
May we find safety from sin's trying hour;  
I Lord, deliver from the evil one,  
All this we ask through Your beloved Son.

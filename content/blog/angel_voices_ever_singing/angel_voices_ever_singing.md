### Representative Text

*1*  
Angel-voices ever singing  
round thy throne of light,  
angel-harps for ever ringing,  
rest not day nor night;  
thousands only live to bless thee  
and confess thee  
Lord of might.  
  
*2*  
Thou who art beyond the farthest  
mortal eye can scan,  
can it be that thou regardest  
songs of sinful man?  
Can we know that thou art near us,  
and wilt hear us?  
Yea, we can.  
  
*3*  
Yea, we know that thou rejoicest  
o'er each work of thine;  
thou didst ears and hands and voices  
for thy praise design;  
craftsman's art and music's measure  
for thy pleasure  
all combine.  
  
*4*  
In thy house, great God, we offer  
of thine own to thee;  
and for thine acceptance proffer  
all unworthily  
hearts and minds and hands and voices  
in our choicest  
psalmody.  
  
*5*  
Honour, glory, might, and merit  
thine shall ever be,  
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,  
blessèd Trinity.  
Of the best that thou hast given  
earth and heaven  
render thee.

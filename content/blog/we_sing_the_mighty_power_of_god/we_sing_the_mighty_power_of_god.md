### Representative Text

*1*  
We sing the mighty power of God  
that made the mountains rise,  
that spread the flowing seas abroad  
and built the lofty skies.  
We sing the wisdom that ordained  
the sun to rule the day;  
the moon shines full at his command,  
and all the stars obey.  
  
*2*  
We sing the goodness of the Lord  
that filled the earth with food;  
he formed the creatures with his word  
and then pronounced them good.  
Lord, how your wonders are displayed,  
where'er we turn our eyes,  
if we survey the ground we tread  
or gaze upon the skies.  
  
*3*  
There's not a plant or flower below  
but makes your glories known,  
and clouds arise and tempests blow  
by order from your throne;  
while all that borrows life from you  
is ever in your care,  
and everywhere that we can be,  
you, God, are present there.

### Representative Text

*1*  
I'm happy in the love of Christ,  
made new to me each day,  
made new to me each day;  
a love whose depths I'll never sound,  
I'll praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,  
I'll praise Him all the way.  
  
*2*  
This love has changed my view of life  
I've now a bright survey,  
I've now a bright survey,  
whatever comes I know 'tis best;  
I'll praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,  
I'll praise Him all the way.  
  
*3*  
God loved me in my sinful hours,  
sin made me disobey,  
sin made me disobey,  
'twas love that crushed my stony heart,  
I'll praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,  
I'll praise Him all the way.  
  
*4*  
O, love, to suffer on a tree;  
aye, what a price to pay,  
aye, what a price to pay  
to open heaven's welcome gates,  
I'll praise Him, praise Him, praise Him, praise Him,  
I'll praise Him all the way.
